# React-Calculator

Things left to do:

- Output messing up for long subtraction expressions (solve later or never)
- add better btn press animation
- for big evals make it e^nth so it can fit screen
- If the first number is more than one digit must be able to multiply with the 2nd number in parenthesis
- write tests in Jest for everything
- learn how to write efficient tests
